#Assignment write up

# Structure:

I defined a class and initialised the mobius strip characteristics, the radius
and the width and the resolution(no.of points in u and v)

Also the surface parameters u,v were intialised, u and v are a set of data points and so for further calculations their mesh grids were made.

3 methods are defined the generate_mobius_plot, calculate_surface_area_of_strip and the calculate_edge_length method.

the first method is used to visulaize mobius strip by making a plot. 
the second and third are used to calculate surafce area and the edge length respectively

finally i created an instance of the mobiusStrip and gave Radius=5, width=2, resolution=200 as characters of my mobius strip

#surface area and edge length were printed and plot is generated, the screenshot is added to my git repo.

#calculation of surface area:

Approximated by integrating(summing up) over magnitude of the cross productof first order partial derivates of small(differential) parametric surface w.r.t u,v.

The first order partial derivatives represent the tangents to differential strip surface

Because the cross product of tangents give normal vector to surface

first the du and dv are calculated my subtracting 2 adjacent elements in their arrays and then the partial derivatives were calculated using gradient function from numpy and then the normal vectors are calculated by doing cross product of the 2 tangents 

tangent1 = <dX_du, dY_du, dZ_du>
tangent2 = <dX_dv, dY_dv, dZ_dv>

the magnitude is then calculated and then the integartion is performed by summing the to be integrated product

magnitude * du * dv

##CHALLENGES:

We were taught the calculation of surface areas in Multivariable calculus course in our semester 1 so i was able to smoothly proceed in surface area calculation

But i got confused and i didnt understand how is the edge length defined for a surface mathematically and so i had to research online for this.

Thank you.
